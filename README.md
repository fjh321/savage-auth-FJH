## Savage-Auth-Complete

For this savage auth project I wrote code that would correctly implement the thumbs up and thumbs down icons as PUT requests on the backedn CRUD functionality for comments left by users. I also made sure to allow for DELETE requests that would delete each comment from the message board of this app.

What I did to build this app:
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to complete this app.

## Lessons Learned :
* CRUD functionality is all about object field maniupulation and implementation. Once I grasped that the backed end holds objects in JSON, I understood how to pull those values out of these objects to use them.
* leanred about the closest() method for targeting elements in the DOM

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage
